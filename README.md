# Lane-Line-Detection

  # INTRODUCTION:
    The traffic safety becomes more and more convincing with
    the increasing urban traffic. Exiting the lane without
    following proper rules is the root cause of most of the
    accidents on the avenues. Most of these are result of the
    interrupted and lethargic attitude of the driver. Lane
    discipline is crucial to road safety for drivers and pedestrians
    alike. The system has an objective to identify the lane
    marks. It’s intent is to obtain a secure environment and
    improved traffic surroundings. The functions of the
    proposed system can range from displaying road line
    positions to the driving person on any exterior display, to
    more convoluted applications like detecting switching of the
    lanes in the near future so that one can prevent concussions
    caused on the highways.
    Actuate detection of lane roads is a critical issue in lane
    detection and departure warning systems. If an automobile
    crosses a lane confinement then vehicles enabled with
    predicting lane borders system directs the vehicles to
    prevent collisions and generates an alarming condition.
    These kind of intelligent system always makes the safe
    travel but it is not always necessary that lane boundaries are
    clearly noticeable, as poor road conditions,

  # Region Of Interest
    A region of interest (ROI) is that area of an image that one
    want to percolate or allow some other operations on them.
    One can use the high-level ROI functions in order to create
    ROIs of many shapes, for example drawpolygon or
    drawcircle in the library of openCV. The main objective of
    ROI is to decrease the portion of an image for speedy
    calculation and also the size of image can be decremented
    by ROI generation. One can describe several ROI in an
    image. Generally, ROIs are defined as collections of several
    contiguous pixels but you can also describe them as ROIs by
    depth values, where it is not necessarily that the regions
    must be contiguous. Most general use of an ROI is to
    generate a binary mask image which is defined as the
    combination of 0 & 1 in the image file matrix. Pixels that
    belong to the ROI are set to 1 that is white and pixels
    outside the ROI are set to 0 that is Black In the mask image.
    There are two images shown below which indicates how
    one’s image may look like after we focus only on the region
    of interest. The original image is as shown below in the Fig
    4.3 and in Fig 4.4 the Region of Interest is shown
